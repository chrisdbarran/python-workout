Thus, we can take the user’s input and break it into words
again, assuming that there are no punctuation characters
and then translate each individual word into Pig Latin.
Whereas the one-word version of our program could simply 
print its output right away, this one needs to store the
accumulated output and then print it all at once. 
It’s certainly possible to use a string for that,
and to invoke += on the string with each iteration.
But as a general rule, it’s not a good idea to build strings
in that way. Rather, you should add elements to a list using
list.append (http://mng.bz/Mdlm) and then invoke str.join to
turn the list’s elements into a long string.
